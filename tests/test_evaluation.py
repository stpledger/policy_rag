Comprehensive Test Suite for Education Policy RAG Evaluation System

This module provides a complete testing framework for the RAG evaluation system,
demonstrating evaluation capabilities, validating system functionality, and
generating sample results for analysis. It serves as both a test suite and a
demonstration of the evaluation system's capabilities.

Key Testing Features:
    - Single Question Evaluation: Individual query assessment and scoring
    - Multi-Strategy Benchmark: Comparative analysis across retrieval methods
    - Performance Validation: Response time and accuracy measurement
    - Quality Metrics Testing: Comprehensive scoring system validation
    - Result Export: JSON output for analysis and reporting
    - Error Handling: Robust testing with graceful failure management

Test Categories:
    1. Single Evaluation Tests:
       - Individual question processing and scoring
       - Answer quality assessment across multiple dimensions
       - Retrieval performance analysis and metrics
       - Source attribution and citation validation
       
    2. Benchmark Testing:
       - Multi-strategy comparison across test question sets
       - Statistical analysis of performance differences
       - Comprehensive evaluation across retrieval methods
       - Performance trend analysis and optimization insights
       
    3. System Integration Tests:
       - End-to-end pipeline functionality validation
       - Configuration system testing and parameter validation
       - Error handling and recovery mechanism testing
       - Performance monitoring and logging verification

Test Question Sets:
    - Education Policy Implementation: Challenges and best practices
    - Reading Interventions: Evidence-based instructional strategies
    - Teacher Professional Development: Training and effectiveness research
    - Student Assessment: Methods and impact analysis
    - Funding and Resources: Policy implications and outcomes
    - Technology Integration: Digital learning and policy considerations

Evaluation Dimensions Tested:
    - Relevance: How well answers address specific questions (1-10)
    - Completeness: Thoroughness and comprehensiveness (1-10)
    - Accuracy: Factual correctness based on source documents (1-10)
    - Clarity: Structure, readability, and logical flow (1-10)
    - Retrieval Precision: Proportion of relevant documents retrieved (0-1)
    - Response Time: End-to-end processing performance (seconds)

Usage:
    >>> # Run complete test suite
    >>> python test_evaluation.py
    >>> 
    >>> # Individual test functions
    >>> from test_evaluation import test_single_evaluation, test_benchmark
    >>> test_single_evaluation()
    >>> benchmark_results = test_benchmark()

Output Files:
    - evaluation_test_results.json: Complete test results with timestamps
    - benchmark_comparison.json: Strategy performance comparison data
    - Console output: Real-time progress and summary statistics

Performance Expectations:
    - Single evaluation: 2-5 seconds per question
    - Benchmark testing: 1-3 minutes for standard question set
    - Memory usage: 1-2GB during comprehensive testing
    - Success rate: >95% for standard education policy queries

Quality Assurance:
    - Automated validation of evaluation metrics ranges
    - Statistical significance testing for benchmark comparisons
    - Error detection and reporting for failed evaluations
    - Performance regression testing and monitoring

Dependencies:
    - Enhanced RAG Pipeline: Core system functionality
    - RAG Evaluator: Comprehensive evaluation framework
    - JSON: Results serialization and export
    - datetime: Timestamp and duration tracking

Note:
    This test suite requires a properly configured RAG system with valid
    OpenAI API keys and access to the education policy document collection.
    Test results provide valuable insights for system optimization and tuning.

        3. Generate comprehensive answer using default strategy
        4. Evaluate answer across all quality dimensions
        5. Analyze retrieval performance and document relevance
        6. Report detailed metrics and performance statistics
